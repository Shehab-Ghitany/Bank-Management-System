# Bank Management System

A C++ console-based application that simulates core banking operations.  
The system is built to handle clients' accounts and manage administrative users with custom permissions.

## Features

- Admin login with username/password authentication
- Role-based access control using permission flags
- View, add, update, delete, and search for client records
- Deposit and withdraw money from client accounts
- Transaction confirmation prompts
- Manage system users with configurable permissions
- All data stored in text files (for learning purposes)

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Data Storage: Plain text files
- Development Approach: Modular programming using functions and enums
- Approx. Lines of Code: 1400+

## Project Structure

- `main.cpp`: Core logic and menu navigation
- `Clients.txt`: Stores client account data
- `Users.txt`: Stores admin user credentials and permissions
- All source files are kept in one organized directory

## Purpose

This project was built as part of a C++ learning path to simulate a real-world mini banking system.  
It focuses on clean logic, data validation, file handling, and access control â€” key concepts in backend development.
